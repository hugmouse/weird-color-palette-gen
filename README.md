# Weird Color Palette Generator

Color palette generator for preview cards,
inspired by Misha Anikin’s article "A very simple color matching algorithm that
works": https://medium.com/@iammishaanikin

## License weirdness

This project was developed independently, following a clean-room design approach based on Anikin’s general
algorithm description. The code includes custom conversion functions between color spaces (RGBA, RGB, HSL),
adapted from LiveOverflow’s resources, with proper attribution and links in the source code comments.

This repository currently does not have a license, so default copyright laws apply.
